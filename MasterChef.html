                        <p>There was a point in time when I lived in an old house with a new kitchen. In the prior months I had crossed the mental threshold where it became increasingly difficult to justify eating “like I was young”, so I began ordering from Hello Fresh, whom is not a sponsor of this blog (that is not indefinite Hello Fresh, look in your court, that is where the ball is). Hello Fresh and likewise meal kits are the Duplo Legos of meal preparation, but nonetheless, I felt like a chef. 
                            <br><br>
                            After a while I decided to remove the training wheels that were Hello Fresh meal kits for two reasons. 1.) I had begun watching cooking tutorials and Master Chef 2.) The Hello Fresh discount code my sister had provided me expired. 
                            <br><br>
                            Thanks to the YouTube tutorials and the addition of green foods to my diet, I had matured. I was ready to master what Master Chef referred to as being a “master chef”. Any time I came across a cooking video I no longer thought “I want to consume that!”. Rather, my mentality had shifted towards “I wonder if I could cook that” and “I wonder if I cooked that with different ingredients if it would be delicious and safe to consume”. Thus, I would try. I replaced the shrimp in the scampi with steak and mutilated the chicken parmesan into what looked like chili but tasted like warm ketchup. 
                            <br><br>
                            This is not a blog about my cooking skills. Homeland security would likely shut down the site for publishing ingredients of terrorism. 
                            <br<br>
                            While I failed to become a master chef, or someone a chef would become Facebook friends with, that delight/curiosity transferred to video games. I’ve played them for most of my life, and eventually, I learned to make them. Now when I see an interesting video game my first thought isn’t “I want to consume that!” it’s “I wonder if I could make that”. 
                            <center><h1>NekoMancer</h1></center>
                            <br>
                            <center><img src="assets/img/Spin.gif" style="width: 100%"></center>
                            <br><br>
                            I have been making a game called NekoMancer for the last few months. In this game you play as a cat that journeys to the afterlife to reconnect with their late owner. The after life is full of ghosts, spirits, and creatures. Creatures are both the afterlife artillery and main form of currency. You, the cat, journey from area to area battling and capturing creatures to grow your abilities to battle rulers of each region to progress. My nephew said “oh, so it’s just Pokémon”. I’ve since stopped letting him beat me at games. 
                            <br><br>
                            I have no plan to release this game, I just wanted to see how much of it I can make. Turns out, I can make a lot of it. I found free assets and purchased others from Itch.io, indulged in tutorials, and opened my C# textbook from college for the first time in a long time. This is not the first game I have built, but it is the first game I’ve built after learning MANY lessons of what TO DO and NOT TO DO from previous projects. Here is a brief summary:
                            <br><br>
                            一.	Use scriptable objects, building enemies and attacks from your script editor is the quickest path towards the “ugh” feeling. 
                            <br><br>
                            二.	Similarly, use prefabs. Did you adjust your health bar to look cool but can’t make the enemies health bar match exactly and now everything feels awful? Should had just made a prefab, my friend.
                            <br><br>
                            三.	Organization. Put scripts and assets in a well named and placed folder. When you need to find sprites for a new character and the file path looks like:
                            
                            <br><br>
                            <center><img src="assets/img/shrekPage.png" style="width: 100%"></center>
                            
                            <br><br>
                            you’re going to feel pain. 
                            <br><br>
                            四.	Clean up your code. If you have a method or coroutine has 0 references and has been replaced by a better one, why is it still in your code? That’s like writing a blog about programming video games and spending the first several paragraphs talking about cooking. Also, chill out on nesting your statements. The compiler is strong, but there’s no need to feed it riddles.
                            <br><br>
                            五.	Debug. Is something that you cannot see supposed to be executing? Write a debug log, determine its functioning now before you build on top of it. Trust me, having to change everything to fix something from a month ago never worked sucks.
                            <br><br>
                            六.	Have your hardly literate nephew or a friend that refuses to read play your game. See how long it takes them to play it well. If they’re successful based on intuition alone, even if they’re bad at it, your game design is smooth as butter coated silk. This does not mean the game is good. But it does mean something, I’m sure.
                            <br><br>
                            七.	Name your variables okay. See how I wrote that? Did I miss a comma? Did you read it as “name your variables, okay?”. Did I use a weak adjective? Am I telling you that your variables should literally be named “okay”. Let’s try that again…
                            <br><br>
                            八.	Name your variables efficiently yet descriptively. 
                            <br><br>
                            九.	Save your work frequently. Engine crashes are like heartbreak, I’ve experienced them multiple times and have developed a method for traveling back to a time before things crashed and burned. However, the latter is between myself and my mind palace. 
                            <br><br>
                            十.	 Two weeks ago, I spoke to a long-time software engineer who stressed the importance of unit testing. Did you know that you can check the functionality of a method? This saves you a lot of time and stress. Do it. 
                            <br><br>
                            十一.	 Be creative and break some stuff. After you’ve saved your work, copy, and paste that bad boy to a new folder. Load that new folder up. Go wild, see what works and what doesn’t. DOCUMENT WHAT YOU DO. You’re working in a dreamland where nothing matters if it breaks…who cares? If it doesn’t break and can contribute positively to your real games fun factor open the real game, look at your documentation, and get it in there. 
                            <br><br>
                            十二.	 PLAY GOOD VIDEO GAMES AND APPRECIATE THE GAME DESIGN. Good game designers borrow, great game designers steal, the best game designers have played Undertale and Dragon Quest 11. 
                            <br><br>

I plan on continuing this blog weekly. I don’t show many people my work, but this seems like a good place to talk about it. My other website (Yahoosilverman.com), while being extremely amateurish by design, was a great outlet for myself and others to ramble. However, I’ve grown in the two years since its creation. I’m in my Master Chef phase now.
