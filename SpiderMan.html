                        <p>In the spring of 2019, I lived in a cold city close to friends I was no longer close with. I worked a job pouring drinks and serving food to people who could afford a caliber of food and drinks I couldn’t because when I wasn’t tending bar and taking orders, I was suffering from what the kindest of hearts have labelled “substance abuse disorder”. Despite the substances I abused being akin to those that lessen pain, the slow-motion suicide that was my life was anything but painless. When I was high my mind would fill with regret. Replaying moments with others I’ll never get to revisit, putting myself in others shoes and wishing I could stay there, regretting my decade long Olympian like dedication to making the wrong decisions at every turn. For years, every time I thought I was done, I was only placing my addiction on sabbatical, a mere oil change and temporary boost to my perpetually double-digit bank account. Thusly, after I while I stopped thinking I was done, it was the most honest with myself I could be in those moments. </p>
                        <p>Today, I have been heroin free for more than 5 years. I can’t attribute this to video games as a whole let nor concept alone a single game, but there was a video game that reignited my love for video games as a whole and concept which was the catalyst for my loving something that even I couldn’t fit into a needle. This game was Spider-Man 2018.</p>
                        <p>I have a brother that is, was, and for the foreseeable future will remain 2 years younger than me. He’s married, owns a home, has a child, and is a professional video game developer. I would reach out to him from time to time, sometimes with double digit month lengths in between, to catch up. It wasn’t possible for me to lie about how “well” I was doing after a while, my wellness was evident, however in the spring of 2019 I was going through another stint of “quitting”. I had been off heroin for some time but was addicted to Suboxone, a chemical used to keep people off heroin that was just as addictive (as I had learned the hard way). It was my birthday, and I was all alone. My phone was much quieter than my drug craving thoughts, but I wanted to stay strong. However, I did receive a gift from my brother. During one of my last stints of sobriety I had purchased a PS4, and having learned this, my brother had sent me a copy of Spider-Man PS4. A game I was too disconnected to know existed. </p>
                        <p>I immediately installed the game, excited and thankful for high internet speeds. I watched review after review for this game. It looked amazing, some pun intended, and I kept checking the install progress bar the same way I would check the time during the darker times of waiting for my dealer to arrive which is when it hit me…this could be good. I’m excited for something that isn’t drugs. I’m distracted by something that isn’t my sadness or regret. This could be good.</p>                       
                        <p>When I tell you that I spent the next several sessions dumping more than 100 hours into that game, I do not exaggerate, nor am I when I tell you I did the same with the Witcher 3 and Watch Dogs 2 next. Dishonored, Batman Arkham Asylum, game after game. I’d fallen back in love with something that wasn’t hurting me. I was rushing home from work to play. I was saving up for new games and hanging out at the local video game shop making friends. I had replaced my habits.  Swinging from webs in a billion-polygon based New York City was exactly what I needed. </p>
                        <p>Video games did not “cure” me, because I’m not “cured”. There will always be that part of me that is capable of destroying my life pushing brown powder into my blue veins and making all the friends and money I’d made along my journey disappear, but video games reminded me that there can be a momentary escape that does not cost you your life in the end. I appreciate you video games. I appreciate you Spider-Man PS4. And thank you, Matt. </p>
