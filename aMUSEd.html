                        <center><h1>Feeling: aMUSEd</h1></center> 
                        <p> Recently, I shared some of my works hosted on my other <a href ="www.yahoosilverman.com">site</a> with someone whom I’ve grown fond of and closer to over the last couple of months. Post her reading a piece constructed of pretentiously syllable stacked words and a lengthy metaphor regarding holes in floors, she used a noun referring to an often-fleshy source of inspiration incarnate. She used the word “muse”.  I’m not sure that I have a “muse” for any of my work, however, I concomitantly cannot confidently admit that I don’t have hundreds of “muses” at the helm of my work. 
                            <br><br>
                            If you’re familiar with myself or my work, you may be aware that the only thing I do more than think posthaste and constantly, is feel laboriously. In any given hour my frontal lobe may miscalculate a short hands relatively brief trip around the clock for the earth’s annually long trip around the sun. I don’t write this to boast nor protest, rather to delineate what I mean by having both no and many muse(s). 
                            <br><br>
                            A sentence I write may be inspired by a set of eyes I’ll never look into again while the next may be motivated by many sets of eyes I wish would see me for who I am. Some pieces I’ve written were inspired by a father who left before I could memorize his face, then died before I could ask for a mulligan, while others are the conclusion to long arguments, I’ve had in my head with people I’ve never met. Love letters that read like the first half of a suicide note, game reviews that lose the plot before a plot could be introduced, satirical pieces acting as a warm coat in the middle of a long winter, all inspired by variables flying into my paragraphs from every direction. They are written by me as the result of everyone and everything I can and do remember, but what matters most to me is that they are written for us. You and me. 
                            <br><br>
                            Writing is my way of processing and to an extent regulating my emotions. My feelings are like a school of fish and writing is the only net I’ve found that works to pull any of them in long enough to distinguish their authenticity. I’m not always sad, nor are my thoughts and feelings. Some of these stampeding waves of electrical signals slamming into my neurons are love shaped and have the potency of a thousand ethically sourced roses. Others, not so much. The precarious task of sorting between the two can be daunting, but writing helps. Thank you for almost literally reading my mind.
