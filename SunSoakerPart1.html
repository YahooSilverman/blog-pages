                        The blackout curtains I purchased in September were nothing more than glorified Cub Scout bandages, so I lay here somewhere in the realm of noon-thirty adjacent to boarded windows on this bitter, numbing November day.                        <br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        If the sun spots me awake, or if I catch it with my own eyes opened, I am convinced beyond any question that I will die. I have no real evidence to affirm this, just a gut feeling that has only steered me wrong a few times over the past 30 years. I’ve explained to my doctor, over the phone seeing as he is only willing to take appointments during the deadly sunlight hours, that I feel I am extra sensitive to solar radiation. In fact, devastatingly so. 
                        <br><br>
                        My doctor asked “What makes you think that? Do you burn easily? Have you tried an SBF 100 sunscreen?”.
                        <br><br>
                        What a crude and ignorant man. Sunscreen? Would you try to block bullets with a beach towel? I explained to this “doctor” that I had done my research, and while his several minutes of knowledge surrounding a rare solar radiation death allergy may pale in comparison my countless hours of online refined internet research, I am still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. 
                        <br><br>
                        “You really should try not to obsess over self-diagnoses. Have you been eating, sleeping, and taking care of yourself?”.
                        <br><br>
                        Is this man even a doctor? At this point I am convinced that he is nothing more than a bought and paid for cog in the machine that is Big Sun™. Don’t push your rays on me, man.
                        <br><br>
                        “Yes, I’ve been taking care of myself. I’ve boarded up my windows and epoxied 2x4 lumber defense boards to block any cracks surrounding my front and back door. I’d say I’m taking damn good care of myself.”
                        <br><br>
                        The line fell silent for a beat.
                        <br><br>
                        As another beat passed us, silence crept through the line like small rays of sun through a peak in the blinds, this doctor sure does think slowly. 
                        <br><br>
                        “I’m going to prescribe you something to help with your condition.”
                        <br><br>
                        It’s about time. Finally, some reprieve. 
                        <br><br>
                        “I’m going to put you on 500mg of Quetiapine and I need you to make a follow up appointment one week from now.”
                        <br><br>
                        Quetiapine. That is what he prescribed a man dealing with a 12-hour daily launch cycle, infinite ammo death ray. Quetiapine. Medicine for lunatics.
